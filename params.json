Possibly, I will make this board public to make use of the voting functionality for new features (or bug priority). I will probably make a separate board that will function as the programming todo-list. I purchased the Unity plugin `PlayMaker` and am also familiar with `Fungus`. I hired an artist to create 3 of my characters. Also purchased (which is optional btw) `Kenney Assets Pack` as I want to use either the roguelike-map-pack or the map-pack as placeholders for the game. I am using my `Stack` account to organize and host all other content that does not belong within source control.\r\n\r\n_Total expenses: 45 + 250 + 5 = €300,-_\r\n___\r\n### Day 2\r\nI set up a `Unity Project` `GitHub` and made another purchase. Private repositories. Maybe someday I will make this open-source but for now I am a little bit afraid China might clone all my progress :) I have created this GitHub page which will function as my DevBlog and I made a GitHub Wiki which will function as a FAQ and have several other interesting pages of topics that I cannot jam into this page.  \r\n\r\nThe artist and I are using a `Google Document` on `Drive` where I have listed character details and references. There are some unclarities still but I am sure we can work these out together. I saw on reddit that Kenney probably is going to update the visuals of the roguelike-map-pack, I should throw him some money for the second `Kenney Asset Pack` soon.      \r\n\r\nI pitched my game idea to three friends, they were positive about it but acknowledged that they hadn't played my kind of genre yet. Showed samples of the two map-packs to one of them and they liked the roguelike-map-pack better so a choice has been made. We also discussed that this game might just be for a niche audience. I am including some (moral) dillemas/ scenario's that might not have been done before and possibly won't be well-received but I consider that a good practice of Indie development :)      \r\n\r\n_Total expenses: €7,- month_\r\n___\r\n### Day 3\r\n\r\nI played Forsaken Isle and Virtual Villagers 2 and 3. I wrote down the good and bad points and what I will take away from them design-wise. I pitched my game to the `Game Dev League` community on `Discord` and got some feedback that I can use. The response was more positive than I thought. Pitching to gamers is scarier than pitching to colleagues haha. I also realized during pitching that my game has a lot of interesting hooks and I added a card to the Trello Board reminding me that I should incorporate these into an `Elevator Pitch`.  \r\n\r\nI found two more Assets made by `Kenney` that I uploaded to `Stack`. Browsing `/r/gamedev` I came across a post about Social Media and learned about the services/ tools `Buffer` and `HootSuite`. Made a Trello card to remind me to investigate these. Also worked on my thesis today #Proud.\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLonely, I am so lonely.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHere have a free *hug*.",
