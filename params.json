Possibly, I will make this board public to make use of the voting functionality for new features (or bug priority). I will probably make a separate board that will function as the programming todo-list. I purchased the Unity plugin `PlayMaker` and am also familiar with `Fungus`. I hired an artist to create 3 of my characters. Also purchased (which is optional btw) `Kenney Assets Pack` as I want to use either the roguelike-map-pack or the map-pack as placeholders for the game. I am using my `Stack` account to organize and host all other content that does not belong within source control.\r\n\r\n_Total expenses: 45 + 250 + 5 = €300,-_\r\n___\r\n### Day 2\r\nI set up a `Unity Project` `GitHub` and made another purchase. Private repositories. Maybe someday I will make this open-source but for now I am a little bit afraid China might clone all my progress :) I have created this GitHub page which will function as my DevBlog and I made a GitHub Wiki which will function as a FAQ and have several other interesting pages of topics that I cannot jam into this page.  \r\n\r\nThe artist and I are using a `Google Document` on `Drive` where I have listed character details and references. There are some unclarities still but I am sure we can work these out together. I saw on reddit that Kenney probably is going to update the visuals of the roguelike-map-pack, I should throw him some money for the second `Kenney Asset Pack` soon.      \r\n\r\nI pitched my game idea to three friends, they were positive about it but acknowledged that they hadn't played my kind of genre yet. Showed samples of the two map-packs to one of them and they liked the roguelike-map-pack better so a choice has been made. We also discussed that this game might just be for a niche audience. I am including some (moral) dillemas/ scenario's that might not have been done before and possibly won't be well-received but I consider that a good practice of Indie development :)      \r\n\r\n_Total expenses: €7,- month_\r\n___\r\n### Day 3\r\n\r\nI played Forsaken Isle and Virtual Villagers 2 and 3. I wrote down the good and bad points and what I will take away from them design-wise. I pitched my game to the `Game Dev League` community on `Discord` and got some feedback that I can use. The response was more positive than I thought. Pitching to gamers is scarier than pitching to colleagues haha. I also realized during pitching that my game has a lot of interesting hooks and I added a card to the Trello Board reminding me that I should incorporate these into an `Elevator Pitch`.  \r\n\r\nI found two more Assets made by `Kenney` that I uploaded to `Stack`. Browsing `/r/gamedev` I came across a post about Social Media and learned about the services/ tools `Buffer` and `HootSuite`. Made a Trello card to remind me to investigate these. Also worked on my thesis today #Proud.\r\n___\r\n###Day 4  \r\n\r\nCreated an \"Implementation\" `Trello Board`. Called it Implementation instead of Programming to make it more accessible for non-programmers in the future. I used a Unity blog post to setup my project for \"Pixel Perfect 2D\". Made a card to remember myself to create a subreddit one day. Found and reproduced my first bug. Unfortunately, the roguelike pack misses one pixel per sprite. Kenney already addressed this in a reddit post, I need to find that post again. I also read that he was planning to remaster the roguelike pack soon so maybe I should wait for that.   \r\n\r\nI watched a `YouTube` tutorial video on \"Custom Actions\" for `PlayMaker`. I made a milestone card listing what I needed for an Alpha 0.1 build. Then from that checklist I took a feature and broke it down again. Working on the map first. Thought of some Survival Events instead (Simulation) of Social Events (Dialogue) and wrote them down. Started messing around with a `FlowChart` using `draw.io` linked with Google Drive. The FlowChart should detail the journey of the player, together with the Design Document in Trello this should make development much easier. Last but not least someone from the community suggested `Hack&Plan` which is like Trello but more game development related. Would love to use it but unfortunately it's not a matured project so I'm not willing to bet on that horse yet (besides already being familiar with Trello and it's voting feature).\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLonely, I am so lonely.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHere have a free *hug*.",
