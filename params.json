Possibly, I will make this board public to make use of the voting functionality for new features (or bug priority). I will probably make a separate board that will function as the programming todo-list. I purchased the Unity plugin `PlayMaker` and am also familiar with `Fungus`. I hired an artist to create 3 of my characters. Also purchased (which is optional btw) Kenney Assets as I want to use either the roguelike-map-pack or the map-pack as placeholders for the game. I am using my `Stack` account to organize and host all other content that does not belong within source control.\r\n\r\nTotal expenses: 45 + 250 + 5 = €300,-\r\n\r\n### Day 2\r\nI set up a `Unity Project` `GitHub` and made another purchase. Private repositories. Maybe someday I will make this open-source but for now I am a little bit afraid China might clone all my progress :) The artist and I are using a `Google Document` on `Drive` where I have listed character details and references. There are some unclarities still but I am sure we can work these out together. I saw on reddit that Kenney probably is going to update the visuals of the roguelike-map-pack, I should throw him some money for the second `Kenney Asset Pack` soon.      \r\n\r\nI pitched my game idea to three friends, they were positive about it but acknowledged that they hadn't played my kind of genre yet. Showed samples of the two map-packs to one of them and they liked the roguelike-map-pack better so a choice has been made. We also discussed that this game might just be for a niche audience. I am including some (moral) dillemas/ scenario's that might not have been done before and possible won't be well-received but I consider that a good practice of Indie development :)      \r\n\r\nTotal expenses: €7,- month\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLonely, I am so lonely.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHere have a free *hug*.",
