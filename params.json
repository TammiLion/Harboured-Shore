Possibly, I will make this board public to make use of the voting functionality for new features (or bug priority). I will probably make a separate board that will function as the programming todo-list. I purchased the Unity plugin `PlayMaker` and am also familiar with `Fungus`. I hired an artist to create 3 of my characters. Also purchased (which is optional btw) `Kenney Assets Pack` as I want to use either the roguelike-map-pack or the map-pack as placeholders for the game. I am using my `Stack` account to organize and host all other content that does not belong within source control.\r\n\r\n_Total expenses: 45 + 250 + 5 = €300,-_\r\n___\r\n### Day 2\r\nI set up a `Unity Project` `GitHub` and made another purchase. Private repositories. Maybe someday I will make this open-source but for now I am a little bit afraid China might clone all my progress :) I have created this GitHub page which will function as my DevBlog and I made a GitHub Wiki which will function as a FAQ and have several other interesting pages of topics that I cannot jam into this page.  \r\n\r\nThe artist and I are using a `Google Document` on `Drive` where I have listed character details and references. There are some unclarities still but I am sure we can work these out together. I saw on reddit that Kenney probably is going to update the visuals of the roguelike-map-pack, I should throw him some money for the second `Kenney Asset Pack` soon.      \r\n\r\nI pitched my game idea to three friends, they were positive about it but acknowledged that they hadn't played my kind of genre yet. Showed samples of the two map-packs to one of them and they liked the roguelike-map-pack better so a choice has been made. We also discussed that this game might just be for a niche audience. I am including some (moral) dillemas/ scenario's that might not have been done before and possibly won't be well-received but I consider that a good practice of Indie development :)      \r\n\r\n_Total expenses: €7,- month_\r\n___\r\n### Day 3\r\n\r\nI played Forsaken Isle and Virtual Villagers 2 and 3. I wrote down the good and bad points and what I will take away from them design-wise. I pitched my game to the `Game Dev League` community on `Discord` and got some feedback that I can use. The response was more positive than I thought. Pitching to gamers is scarier than pitching to colleagues haha. I also realized during pitching that my game has a lot of interesting hooks and I added a card to the Trello Board reminding me that I should incorporate these into an `Elevator Pitch`.  \r\n\r\nI found two more Assets made by `Kenney` that I uploaded to `Stack`. Browsing `/r/gamedev` I came across a post about Social Media and learned about the services/ tools `Buffer` and `HootSuite`. Made a Trello card to remind me to investigate these. Also worked on my thesis today #Proud.\r\n___\r\n###Day 4  \r\n\r\nCreated an \"Implementation\" `Trello Board`. Called it Implementation instead of Programming to make it more accessible for non-programmers in the future. I used a Unity blog post to setup my project for \"Pixel Perfect 2D\". Made a card to remember myself to create a subreddit one day. Found and reproduced my first bug. Unfortunately, the roguelike pack misses one pixel per sprite. Kenney already addressed this in a reddit post, I need to find that post again. I also read that he was planning to remaster the roguelike pack soon so maybe I should wait for that.   \r\n\r\nI watched a `YouTube` tutorial video on \"Custom Actions\" for `PlayMaker`. I made a milestone card listing what I needed for an Alpha 0.1 build. Then from that checklist I took a feature and broke it down again. Working on the map first. Thought of some Survival Events instead (Simulation) of Social Events (Dialogue) and wrote them down. Started messing around with a `FlowChart` using `draw.io` linked with Google Drive. The FlowChart should detail the journey of the player, together with the Design Document in Trello this should make development much easier. Last but not least someone from the community suggested `Hack&Plan` which is like Trello but more game development related. Would love to use it but unfortunately it's not a matured project so I'm not willing to bet on that horse yet (besides already being familiar with Trello and it's voting feature).\r\n___\r\n###Day 5\r\n\r\nFixed the black lines/ gaps between tiles. Installed Rainbow Folders plugin to color folders and easier identify where I want to browse. Started learning Tiled and installed the Tiled2Unity plugin (ran into some issues with the .NET framework). All that is left now is to set-up the TiledMap correctly with the 'Pixel Perfect 2D' camera script. It was a long day with a bunch of obstacles (see Wiki) and fixes. Almost there and then I can finally implement the Map feature of the simulation part of the game.\r\n___\r\n###Day 6\r\n#####Streak broken: 26-06-2016\r\n\r\nThe previous two days I was playing Nekopara Vol 1. While I do feel playing games is important for Game Design Research I will not include it in the DevBlog, I do consider writing about it in the Game Design & Theory section of the Wiki. It seems to me playing games would be a little bit of cheating with the DevBlog as it is also relaxation/ entertainment.   \r\n\r\nNekopara is a non-interactive Visual Novel and the reviews were extremely positive. I just really wanted to know/ understand it's success. I wrote down its good points on a Trello Card and what I can use for my own game. As for why I think it's successful:   \r\n\r\n- Gorgeous `Live2D` Animations (I need to check out whether I can learn this program and possibly use it in this game)\r\n- Cute characters\r\n- Probably the H-scenes\r\n- Chapter 2 managed to make my heart churn so that was really good but it did not occur anymore later in the story  \r\n\r\nI also bought Vol 0, Vol 2 and was told about Sono Hanabira so I downloaded two of them, bought Kiss of the Petals - Remembering How We Met and last but not least VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action because it had great reviews that talked about it being a VN-hybrid. Where I used to play games because I liked them now I am trying out more games that aren't my style but do belong to the genre. What is their charm? Why 'play' a non-interactive Visual Novel? How much do the H-scenes matter?   \r\n\r\nWhen I played games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Persona 3/4 I was the player. Now that I'm building a similar game like these I cannot just see everything from the perspective of the player type that I am. I would always pick the pretty type with the long hair but I cannot fill my entire game with this character trope. I want to make sure everyone has a character they like (the most). I want to make sure that the Dating Sim part of my game is balanced.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, I took a lot of inspiration from the Epic Tavern `Kickstarter` and their `r/iAmA`. They didn't just have Kickstarter Stretch Goals but also Social Stretch Goals and they talked briefly how they used Facebook ads and that one should be careful with using Facebook Demographic's tools.\r\n\r\nI had a bit more communication with my artist trying to make her artistic process more smoothly and also offering to pay more if needed as I realized that I want fairly complex characters and she should be compensated fairly for her time. I also discovered `www.vapsquad.com` and we discussed a bit about the voice acting that I would want for my game. The important thing would be to have enough female voices for the game and they assured me they can easily cover that. They have sent me a demo that I will have to check out. $35 per character + commercial licensing + editing is very do-able. I didn't even consider voice-acting before but I feel like I can definitely save some money from my day job for this :)\r\n\r\nI have thought about how to make my 'Pixel Perfect 2D' camera script work with Tiled2Unity but alas haven't gotten farther than the idea of just number tweaking. Once I find a solution I will definitely discuss this in detail in the Obstacles Wiki so that other devs don't have to fight with this problem as well.\r\n\r\nLast but not least I wrote down my marketing pitch/ elevator pitch!\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLonely, I am so lonely.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHere have a free *hug*.",
