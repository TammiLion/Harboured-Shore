<p>I created a <code>Trello Board</code> which contains planning and functions as a Design Document. Possibly, I will make this board public to make use of the voting functionality for new features (or bug priority). I will probably make a separate board that will function as the programming todo-list. I purchased the Unity plugin <code>PlayMaker</code> and am also familiar with <code>Fungus</code>. I hired an artist to create 3 of my characters. Also purchased (which is optional btw) Kenney Assets as I want to use either the roguelike-map-pack or the map-pack as placeholders for the game. I am using my <code>Stack</code> account to organize and host all other content that does not belong within source control.</p>

<a id="day-2" class="anchor" href="#day-2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Day 2</h3>

<p>I set up a <code>Unity Project</code> <code>GitHub</code> and made another purchase. Private repositories. Maybe someday I will make this open-source but for now I am a little bit afraid China might clone all my progress :) I have created this GitHub page which will function as my DevBlog and I made a GitHub Wiki which will function as a FAQ and have several other interesting pages of topics that I cannot jam into this page.  </p>

<p>The artist and I are using a <code>Google Document</code> on <code>Drive</code> where I have listed character details and references. There are some unclarities still but I am sure we can work these out together. I saw on reddit that Kenney probably is going to update the visuals of the roguelike-map-pack, I should throw him some money for the second <code>Kenney Asset Pack</code> soon.      </p>

<p>I pitched my game idea to three friends, they were positive about it but acknowledged that they hadn't played my kind of genre yet. Showed samples of the two map-packs to one of them and they liked the roguelike-map-pack better so a choice has been made. We also discussed that this game might just be for a niche audience. I am including some (moral) dillemas/ scenario's that might not have been done before and possibly won't be well-received but I consider that a good practice of Indie development :)      </p>
